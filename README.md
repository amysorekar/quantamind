## Dataset choice

Quantamind's core value is building LLMs that are tailored to business workflows. This usually includes:
- Understanding internal documents and interactions
- Responding to structured and unstructured business data
- Automating Q&A, summarization, and other supporting tasks

I chose the twitter dataset because:
- It is publicly available and has a lot of real-world text data
- It has real interactions between customers and brand responses
- It fits into at LLM naturally (user text -> response)
- No PII or PHI
- Smaller size for fine-tuning (after subsetting)
