# What You Need to Build
## An AI Agent that:
• Uses an open-source Large Language Model (LLM)

• Works with a publicly available dataset

• Has an Inference Engine (to reason or draw conclusions, like using rules or logic)

• Is fine-tuned (custom-trained) for better performance on your chosen task

## What Is Expected from You
Two Different Approaches:

• Use two different ways/methods to build and fine-tune your AI agent

• Compare the Two Methods

• Show how each method performs using real numbers:

• Any useful metric depending on your task

• Choose the Best Method

• Based on your results, pick the better approach

• Give a clear reason why it's better (using the numbers/metrics)

## Your Final Deliverables

• Link to code in a GitHub repository

• A clear and detailed README file with:

• Project description

• Model & dataset used

• Explanation of both methods

• Steps to run the code

• Results and performance comparison

• Final conclusion and recommendation
